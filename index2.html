  <h2>Catagories of Programing Languages</h2>
  <p class="myfirstclass">The table below shows the different catagories of programing Languages with their descriptions.</p>
<table id="mytable">
  <tr>
    <th>Catagory</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Machine Language</td>
    <td>Machine language is the direct representation of the code and data run directly by a computing device.</td>
    </tr>
    <td>Assembly Language</td>
    <td>An assembly language is an encoding of machine code into something more readable. It assigns human-readable labels (or names) to storage locations, jump targets, and subroutine starting addresses, but doesnâ€™t really go too far beyond that.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>High-level Language</td>
    <td>A high-level language gets away from all the constraints of a particular machine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>System Language</td>
    <td>System programming languages differ from application programming languages in that they are more concerned with managing a computer system rather than solving general problems in health care, game playing, or finance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Scripting Language</td>
    <td>Scripting languages are used for wiring together systems and applications at a very high level. They are almost always extremely expressive (they do a lot with very little code) and usually dynamic (meaning the compiler does very little, while the run-time system does almost everything).</td>
    </tr>
   <tr> 
    <td>Doamin-Specific Language</td>
    <td> used in highly special-purpose areas only</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Visual Language</td>
    <td>non-text based language</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Esoteric Language</td>
    <td>An esoteric language is one not intended to be taken seriously. They can be jokes, near-minimalistic, or despotic (purposely obfuscated or non-deterministic).</td>
  </tr>
